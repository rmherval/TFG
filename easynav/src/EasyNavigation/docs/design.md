## Things to decide

1. Name: I propose "EasyNavigation"
2. License: Apache-2.0
  1. Pro: It lets to include Apache 2.0 and BSD
  2. Pro: It lets to create a bussines model based on selling versions with privative license
  3. Contra: Some people could have concerns to use the software
  4. Fact: We should mantain the entire copyright, so we should inform in each PR that the full copyright is ours
